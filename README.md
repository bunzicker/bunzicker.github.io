# About

Welcome to my personal website. I am a physicist at The Ohio State University studying high intensity laser plasma interactions using the PW-class Scarlet laser and *ab initio* particle-in-cell simulations.

On this site, you can follow my professional activities and occasionally get a small glimpse into my personal life.
