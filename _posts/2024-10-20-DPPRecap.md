I recently attended the American Physical Society's Division of Plasma Physics Conference in Atlanta, Georgia, where I presented my work on developing an XUV source with tunable orbital angular momentum. My poster from the Thursday afternoon session is shown below. Please note that everything shown below is still preliminary results.

I was also able to hear about the work being done by others around the world. The highlight was the Multi-Petawatt Physics mini-conference where current progress on the design, development, and utilization of mult-PW lasers was discussed. In the first of the mini-conference's four sessions, I learned about the design goals of the dual 25 PW [NSF OPAL](https://nsf-opal.rochester.edu/) laser to be housed at the University of Rochester, commisioning experiments at the Univeristy of Michigan's [ZEUS](https://zeus.engin.umich.edu/) Laser, and capabilities of the [Extreme Light Infrastructure](https://eli-laser.eu/) in Europe. I was really impressed by the stability and robustness of the HAPLS laser at ELI Beamlines (especially when talking with users who have performed experiments there). My favorite talk of the conference was Friday morning by Mattew Edwards who showed his work using plasma-based diffraction gratings to greatly increase the temporal contrast of high power lasers. I was also able to hear talks by students and researchers in other fields of plasma physics, such as dusty plasmas, fusion, and warm dense matter.

Overall, I had a great time at DPP, both sharing my research and hearing about the work of others.
