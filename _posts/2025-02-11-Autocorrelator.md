title:  Pulse duration measurements using a single shot autocorrelator
categories: Research
excerpt: In this post, I describe Scarlet's autocorrelator that we use to measure the laser pulse duration. I also show a new graphical user interface I designed to streamline its use.

One of the biggest challenges when using ultrashort laser pulses is determining the pulse duration. Lasers like Scarlet can have pulse durations on the order of tens of femtoseconds (1 fs = $10^{-15}$ s). This is faster than the time over which most chemical reactions take place! This ultrashort duration is necessary to reach the extremely how peak powers that enable us to generate relativistic matter. Often many of the most interesting processes are highly sensitive to the peak laser intensity, so knowledge of the laser pulse duration is crucial. But how do you measure this without something shorter? Even the fastest electrical signals can only go down to hundreds of picoseconds (1 ps = $10^{-12}$ s), meaning it is impossible to use something like an oscilloscope to resolve the pulse duration.

They can also be used to generate even shorter pulses used to probe the attosecond timescale. (Credit: Hertel, I. and Schulz, C.

Luckily, there are many techniques have been invented to determine the laser pulse duration using much slower detectors. The simplest of theses is the *intensity autocorrelator*. Mathematically, an autocorrelation is a convolution between some signal and itself
$$
\begin{align}
    A(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty dt \; f(t) f(t - \tau)
\end{align}
$$
Physically, a laser autocorrelator does this same thing. In the simplest case, the undiagnosed pulse is split into two copies with a beam splitter, both beams are focused into a nonlinear crystal, and a camera or photodiode measures the intensity of the resultant light. The autocorrelation signal can be measured by changing the delay between the two beams using a translation stage. Second harmonic generation (SHG) crystals like BBO and KDP are typical nonlinear media in many autocorrelators. Because SHG is a $\chi^{(2)}$ process, the intensity depends on the time integral of $|E(t) + E(t - \tau)|^2$. Expanding the product shows that one of the three terms is the autocorrelation defined earlier.

However, because Scarlet has a relatively low repetition rate of 10 Hz, we have built a single-shot autocorrelator. The principle is the same: we measure the intensity of light generated by overlapping two beams in an SHG crystal. But rather than manually adjusting the delay using a translation stage, we focus the light with a cylindrical lens, so that different a range of delays are made by the two beams having different path lengths. The basic setup is shown below.

Recently, I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) to operate the autocorrelator. It has several nice features, letting users interact with the camera directly, analyze the raw image, extract the pulse duration, and save the data to a file. It is written to be operated as a black-box, so that even users without Python experience can easily operate Scarlet's vacuum autocorrelator. The software uses [PyPylon](https://github.com/basler/pypylon) to interact with the camera, SciPy's curve fitting routines to obtain the pulse duration, and the GUI is written with Tom Schimansky's [customtkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/). We've used it a few times so far, and it seems to work pretty well. See a screenshot below.
